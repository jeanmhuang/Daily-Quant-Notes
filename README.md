# Daily Quant Notes

A collection of small, daily experiments in quantitative finance and data science.  
Each day I explore a new concept, model, or dataset in Python, SQL, or Jupyter.  

## Contents
- Factor backtests (momentum, value, volatility)
- Portfolio construction and risk metrics
- Market data analysis (ETF flows, sector rotation)
- Machine learning experiments for signal prediction
- Visualizations and utilities

This repo reflects my ongoing learning process and showcases my approach to systematic, hypothesis-driven research.
